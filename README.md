# `<blockquote>` plugin for Moodle Atto

Provides `<blockquote>` markup to the Moodle Atto editor.

A tweaked conflation of of the 'atto_bold' and 'atto_title' plugins.

The University of Southern Queensland (http://www.usq.edu.au) provides this plugin in the hope that it is useful, but does not offer support for it.
